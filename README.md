# 🚀 Fetch Implementation (JavaScript Mini Projects)

A collection of mini projects demonstrating the use of the Fetch API in JavaScript to get data from various APIs and display it dynamically on the page using event handling and DOM manipulation.

# What This Project Shows

This repository contains multiple simple JavaScript scripts that use the Fetch API to:

✔ Request data from external APIs

✔ Parse JSON responses

✔ Dynamically update the web page

✔ Handle user interactions through buttons and input

These examples illustrate how to connect frontend UI elements with live API data using modern JavaScript.

# Features in Each Script

🎯 fetch1.js

Uses the Fetch API to get simple JSON data and display it on the page with a button click.

🐱 fetch2.js

Fetches cat facts and displays them dynamically when the user interacts with the UI.

📸 fetch3.js

Retrieves random dog images using the Dog API and shows them in the browser.

🎓 fetch4.js

Pulls data from a college API based on user input and lists results in the UI.
